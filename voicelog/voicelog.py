    be derived later by joining ``voice_sessions`` against itself on
    matching ``channel_id`` with overlapping ``[start_time, end_time]``
    windows. Cross-referencing against the ``gamelog`` cog's ``sessions``
    table (matching ``user_id``, overlapping time) shows what game someone
    was playing during a given voice session. Those joins are the intended
